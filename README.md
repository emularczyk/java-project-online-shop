# Working with the H2 database

1. Run application.
2. Go to `http://localhost:8080/console`.
3. If you use spring security, you have to log in with login `user` and password displayed in the console for 
   example `c0b34ae6-d987-4e8e-8d6b-2df183b7ecff`.
4. In the form set driver as `org.h2.Driver` and JDBC url as `jdbc:h2:path_to_db_files\database;MODE=MySQL`,
where path_to_db_files is path to your `database.mv.db` file.
5. Connect and modify database.

Tip: H2 syntax is very rigorous (in contrast to mySql), so any inaccurate entry in your code may cause error.
